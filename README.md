### Abstract
Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles that play a central role in the tumor microenvironment, maintaining interactions between cancer, stromal and immune cells that result in many tumor-promoting functionalities. In particular, they are widely associated with therapeutic drug resistance. Multiple research studies show that the addition of purified extracellular vesicles to drug-sensitive cells, including bacteria and mammalian cells in vitro, increase their survival against different toxins. It is also well known that cancer cells engage in stress responses leading to increased exosome production when exposed to cytotoxic drugs. These observations suggest that one of the advantages of the exogenous vesicle overload might be to buffer the toxicity of the environment by providing a protective shield to the cells, a mechanism of resistance that doesnâ€™t require costly intracellular adaptations to cope with toxic molecules. In this work we test the implications of this hypothesis in an agent-based compartmental model of cancer response to chemotherapy. We simulate the population dynamics of three phenotypes of cancer cells: drug-resistant cells, sensitive cells, and sensitive cells that vesiculate at a rate proportional to the drug concentration in their vicinity. Additionally, exosomes in the milieu bind to the cytotoxic drug effectively diluting its effect on the sensitive populations. While assuming a stiff fitness cost to resistance and a mild cost to vesiculation, we explore model parameters like rates of cell kinetics, diffusion and vesiculation, to approximate realistic conditions and investigate the impact of the exosomic decoy effect in the population dynamics under different drug dosing conditions.  We speculate that promoting vesicular decoys could be of benefit as a novel therapeutic strategy seeking to achieve disease management, in the form of tumor-burden stabilization, by maintaining the tumor diversity and avoiding the competitive release of the resistant phenotype in the cell population.
